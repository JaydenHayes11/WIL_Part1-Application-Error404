## Design Considerations

### Theme:

* **Color Palette**: The design uses dark blue and white as the primary colors, which provide a clean and professional look. Bright accents (possibly yellow or orange) are used for call-to-action buttons, making them stand out.
* **Typography**: The typography is simple and clean, ensuring that text is readable on smaller mobile screens. Consistent use of bold headings and body text provides a clear structure.

### Layout:

* **Header**: On every screen, the app features a navigation bar with the Empowering the Nation logo, along with menu options (Home, Courses, About, Contact).
* **Footer**: Each screen includes a footer with quick links to important sections (Home, Courses, About, Contact), along with contact information (email and phone number).
* **Card Design**: Courses are displayed in cards with concise details, including duration, cost, and description. This layout makes it easy for users to compare different offerings.

### Mobile Optimization:

* The app is designed specifically for iPhone 14 & 15 Pro screens, ensuring that the interface is optimized for the latest screen sizes and resolution. The design ensures that buttons are touch-friendly and the layout is responsive.
